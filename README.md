## Decred Flatpak repository builder


Manual Flatpak build:

```bash
scripts/build.sh
```

The repo contains a [Github workflow](.github/workflows/flatpak.yml) as well, which builds the flatpak and publishes the artifacts to the [Decred Flatpak repo](https://peterzen.github.io/decred-flatpak-repo).  The workflow can be manually triggered.
